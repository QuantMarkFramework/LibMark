    "# Calculating baseline energies\n",
    "Each choice of basis set results in a slightly different energy curve for the same hydrogen molecule. This is because some basis sets describe all the interacting factors within the molecule more accurately than others. Of course, a more detailed description would result in more classical compute time and possibly more qubits on the system, hence most research is done using `STO-3G` since that basis set can be represented with the least qubits.\n",
    "\n",
    "For fair comparisons of any VQE algorithm simulating the same molecule, we define a \"gold standard\" baseline. This is the energy curve that would be obtained with the most accurate classical numerical method currently available. This is not just the `fci` method for taking into account the full configuration interaction between the particles in the molecule, but also the most accurate basis set (we found `\"def2-QZVPPD\"`, please let me know if there is something better). Moreover, the baseline will consider the full active space of the molecule, so the core remains unfrozen and no electrons are ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ofcourse, this doesn't give enough insight into how the VQE is performing with respect its classical counter part because the VQE is probably using a completely different basis set that is much less accurate. For this purpuse, we also introduce the `experiment_truth`, this is the `fci` energy of the same molecule under the same restrictions as the VQE (i.e. the same basis_set, active space, etc.). This is the theoretical optimum of the VQE performance. If it needs to be more accurate, you would need a different basis_set or more qubits to represent all the electrons.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, we want to introduce an upperbound for the VQE performance where we can say for certain that the algorithm is performing poorly. For this, we use the `hf` method. The Hartree-fock method for calculating the molecular energy is a rather crude approximation of the energy that only takes into account a single slater determinant. As such, it doesn't take into account the interactions between the electrons in the molecule, which makes the calculations much simpler numerically, but the resulting energy is not very accurately. A good VQE algorithm should at least be able to take into account the interactions between electrons. We call this baseline the `experiment_approximation` and it is the same as the experiment_truth except that is using Hartree-Fock instead of the full configuration interaction as numerical method.\n",
